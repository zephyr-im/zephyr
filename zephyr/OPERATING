This file explains how to operate a Zephyr service once you have
installed Zephyr on all the relevant machines and file servers in your
environment.  To learn how to configure, build, and install Zephyr,
read the file INSTALL.

To set up Zephyr service at a site, follow these steps:

1. Choose the machines you wish to have act as Zephyr servers at your
site.  Expect the server to be CPU-efficient but to consume a bit more
memory than you might expect (at MIT, with around a thousand
simultaneous users, the Zephyr server's data size is 40MB).  If you
have a lot of users, the server should have enough memory so that the
process doesn't swap.

2a. If you configured Zephyr with Hesiod support, make sure your
Hesiod realm has a "zephyr.sloc" entry containing a record for each
server.  (Each entry should contain the name of the server, nothing
else.)  The Zephyr servers will use the zephyr.sloc entry to find the
other servers.  Host managers will use the zephyr.sloc entry to find
the Zephyr servers by default; however, you can control the set of
servers for each host manager by giving each host a
"<hostname>.cluster" entry containing a record "zcluster <serverset>".
If such a record is found, the host manager will resolve
"<serverset>.sloc" instead of "zephyr.sloc".

2b. If you configured Zephyr without Hesiod support, and you have
multiple Zephyr servers, each server should have a file "server.list"
in the configuration directory (which is /etc/athena/zephyr if you
configured with --enable-athena, or /usr/local/etc/zephyr if you
installed Zephyr in /usr/local and didn't use --enable-athena).  This
file should contain a list of the servers, one per line.

3. If you configured Zephyr with Kerberos 4 support, make a service
key "zephyr.zephyr@<your realm>" and install a srvtab for that service
as "srvtab" in the configuration directory of each of your zephyr
servers.

4. Start zephyrd from the system binary directory (/usr/athena/etc if
you configured with --enable-athena, /usr/local/sbin if you installed
in /usr/local and didn't use --enable-athena).  zephyrd logs as
service "local6"; watch the syslogs for error messages.  Arrange for
zephyrd to be run at boot time on your server machines.

5. Each client machine should run zhm (the Zephyr Host Manager) from
the local system binary directory (/etc/athena for --enable-athena,
/usr/local/sbin if you installed in /usr/local and didn't use
--enable-athena).  If you built Zephyr without Hesiod support, you
should start zhm as "zhm server1 server2 server3 ..." so that zhm
knows where the Zephyr servers are.  Do not use "localhost" or
"127.0.0.1" as a server name, or zhm will become confused.

You can send a SIGFPE signal to the server process to make it dump its
subscription database to /var/tmp/zephyr.db.  (If /var/tmp didn't
exist when Zephyr was built, the subscription database will be dumped
in /usr/tmp or /tmp instead.)
