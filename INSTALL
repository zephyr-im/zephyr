This file explains how to build and install Zephyr on a machine.  To
learn how to use Zephyr once you've installed it, read the file USING.
To learn how to set up Zephyr service at a site, read the file
OPERATING.

To build and install Zephyr, run:

	./configure
	make
	make install

This will build Zephyr without Hesiod or Kerberos support, and install
in /usr/local.  To install in a location other than /usr/local, add
"--prefix=INSTPREFIX" to the configure line, where INSTPREFIX is the
directory you want to install Zephyr in.

If your site has a Hesiod service with a valid zephyr.sloc entry (or
you can add one), you can enable Hesiod support by adding the option
"--with-hesiod=HESPREFIX" to the configure line, where
HESPREFIX/include and HESPREFIX/lib are the directories you have the
Hesiod libraries installed in.

If your site has a Kerberos 5 service, you can enable Kerberos 5 support
by adding the option "--with-krb5=KRBPREFIX" to the configure line,
where KRBPREFIX/include and KRBPREFIX/lib are the directories you
have the Kerberos libraries installed in.

If you have a make which supports VPATH in a manner compatible with
GNU make, you can build in a separate directory.  Simply invoke the
configure script from within the build directory and configure will
locate the source directory for you.  (If that doesn't work for some
reason, you can also specify "--srcdir=SOURCEDIR" on the configuration
line.)

If configure can't properly find your X11 include or library
directories, add "--x-includes=INCDIR" and "--x-libraries=LIBDIR" to
the configure line.  To build without X11 support, add "--without-x"
to the configure line.

If you have Hesiod and/or Kerberos installed such that you can't
specify a single prefix for both include files and libraries, set the
environment variables CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to include the relevant
directories, and just configure with "--with-krb5" and
"--with-hesiod".  For instance (for a csh-like shell):

	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/opt/athena/include"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-I/opt/athena/arch/sparc/lib"
	./configure --with-hesiod --with-krb5
	make
	make install

Although it's not necessary for Zephyr to function correctly, you
should add the following services to /etc/services if possible:

zephyr-clt      2103/udp                        # Zephyr serv-hm connection
zephyr-hm       2104/udp                        # Zephyr hostmanager
zephyr-hm-srv	2105/udp			# Zephyr hm-serv connection

To learn how to use Zephyr, read the file USING and the man pages for
the various Zephyr programs.  To learn how to operate a Zephyr
service, read the file OPERATING.

We have tried to make Zephyr as portable as is reasonably possible,
but have not taken into account every possible kind of system.  If you
have any problems building or installing Zephyr according to these
instructions, please go to http://zephyr.1ts.org and open a ticket.
