Zephyr Library Tests

This file is a collection of doctests for the zephyr library.
Minimum coverage goal is "every non-static function, and every data
structure that shows up in those function prototypes."

This file is also a test of the practicality of rich doctests as API
documentation.  It will start out as a bunch of snippets, and later be
edited to use actual chapters and appendices - narrative structure
beyond "here's a test! here's another test!"  At that point we'll also
pick a formatting language (probably ReStructured Text but for now, we
need no more than whitespace separated paragraphs to be
comprehensible.)

Generic library setup that should be moved into zephyr_tests.py:

   >>> import os
   >>> import zephyr_tests
   >>> buildpath = zephyr_tests.find_buildpath()
   >>> libzephyr_path = os.path.join(buildpath, ".libs", "libzephyr.so.4.0.0")
   >>> _z = zephyr_tests.libZephyr(libzephyr_path)

ZInit() got run by libZephyr, internally.  Make sure other things
actually got set up:

   >>> assert _z.ZGetFD() == -1
   >>> realm = _z.ZGetRealm()
   >>> assert realm
   >>> assert realm != "local-realm"
   >>> assert _z.ZGetSender()
   >>> assert "@" in _z.ZGetSender()

ZNotice_t structure pseudo-round-trip (needs a lot more explicit
settings and assertions to be a real round-trip test...)

   >>> notice = zephyr_tests.ZNotice_t()
   >>> from ctypes import sizeof
   >>> assert sizeof(notice) > 150
   >>> from ctypes import c_char_p, c_int
   >>> zbuf = c_char_p(0)
   >>> zbuflen = c_int(0)
   >>> st = _z.ZFormatNotice(notice, zbuf, zbuflen, zephyr_tests.ZNOAUTH)
   >>> assert st == 0
   >>> assert zbuf.value.startswith("ZEPH")
   >>> new_notice = zephyr_tests.ZNotice_t()
   >>> st = _z.ZParseNotice(zbuf, zbuflen, new_notice)
   >>> assert st == 0
   >>> assert new_notice.z_version.startswith("ZEPH")

Should we check for ZEPH0.2 now, or leave that open?

Simple test of ZCompareUID:

   >>> uid1 = zephyr_tests.ZUnique_Id_t()
   >>> uid2 = zephyr_tests.ZUnique_Id_t()
   >>> assert _z.ZCompareUID(uid1, uid2), "null uids don't match"

There's no ZUnique_Id_t constructor - Z_FormatHeader and
Z_NewFormatHeader initialize notice->z_uid directly, so cheat and use
ZNotice_t as the constructor...

   >>> notice1 = zephyr_tests.ZNotice_t()
   >>> zbuf = c_char_p(0)
   >>> zbuflen = c_int(0)
   >>> st = _z.ZFormatNotice(notice1, zbuf, zbuflen, zephyr_tests.ZNOAUTH)
   >>> assert st == 0, "ZFormatNotice notice1 failed"

   >>> notice2 = zephyr_tests.ZNotice_t()
   >>> zbuf = c_char_p(0)
   >>> zbuflen = c_int(0)
   >>> st = _z.ZFormatNotice(notice2, zbuf, zbuflen, zephyr_tests.ZNOAUTH)
   >>> assert st == 0, "ZFormatNotice notice1 failed"

   >>> assert not _z.ZCompareUID(notice1.z_uid, notice2.z_uid), "distinct notices don't compare as distinct"

Trivial test of ZExpandRealm, using terribly well known hostnames:

   >>> assert _z.ZExpandRealm("") == ""
   >>> assert _z.ZExpandRealm("localhost") == ""
   >>> assert _z.ZExpandRealm("bitsy.mit.edu") == "ATHENA.MIT.EDU"
